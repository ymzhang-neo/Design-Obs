# Design-Obs
Reusable code for designing observational studies

This repo contains R code for functions that may be used for the design of observational studies. Typical tasks may include:
- To estimate propensity scores (Rosenbaum and Rubin 1983),
- To subclassify experimental units based on their propensity scores (Imbens and Rubin 2015), and
- To assess the covariate balance after matching/subclassification.
